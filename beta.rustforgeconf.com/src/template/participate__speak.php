                Format for the conference </h2>
            <p>
                The conference is a single-track event, but there's an important difference. Delegates will be strongly
                encouraged to leave the room if there are sessions that they're not interested in. We're genuine when we
                mean that the "hallway track" is a main track. </p>
            <p>
                Make use of the networking opportunities through the social spaces and the hallway track. This is a
                feature, not a bug. It means that the people who are watching your talk _really_ want to be there. </p>

                How to give your idea the best chance </h2>
            <p>
                If you are the developer of an open source project, we want to hear from you! But, please note this is a
                single track event and we need the material to appeal to a broad audience. </p>

                How to give your idea the best chance </h2>
            <p>
                Allow your enthusiasm to shine through. Please tell us why you're excited to present. </p>
            <p>
                A short introduction is good. Generally, no introduction is better. </p>
            <p>
                Finish the code before starting the proposal. You should talk about things that you've learned, not
                about software that you hope to write between now and August. </p>
            <p>
                Think of your audience first. Every presentation must add to the experience. </p>
            <p>
                Do not think of Rust Forge 2025 as a chance to provide an advertorial or infomercial. Instead, try to
                think of an opportunity to share what you've learned. You should make sure that your talk is something
                that you would want to listen to if you were not employed by your company, or didn't work. </p>

                Intended audience </h2>
            <p>
                The conference will appeal most to software developers who interested in the Rust programming
                language. </p>
            <p>
                Rust Forge is physically located in New Zealand as part of the Asia Pacific region. </p>
            <p>
                As Rust is not a predominant language in Australia and New Zealand, the conference is likely to draw a
                large contingent of people who are not experienced in the language. Their interests will be in ensuring
                that they can gain knowledge about something that is becoming more important globally. </p>
            <p>
                Rust Forge is not a conference to talk about the development of the the programming language itself.
                That's a job for Rust Conf. </p>

            <p>
                The programme will be developed to create a cohesive whole. In general, we are looking to create
                sessions of 2-4 talks, followed by a group discussion with all of the speakers from that session. </p>
