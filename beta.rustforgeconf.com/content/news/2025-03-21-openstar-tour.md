Thanks to [OpenStar Technologies], delegates to Rust Forge Conf 2025 get to visit a fusion reactor prototype. Sweet! 

-> Register https://rust-forge-2025.lilregie.com/

The tour will take you through OpenStar's engineering facility, including its workshop and reactor. You'll learn some of the physics behind the fusion reactions, how the team designed and machined all of their own parts on site, and of course you'll meet [Junior], OpenStar's fusion magnet,  up and close. 

Junior achieved [first plasma on 31 October 2024] and is functional today. From a physics and engineering perspective, it's especially interesting as it's a levitated dipole magnet, which is significantly less complex than more conventional tokamak fusion reactors.

What's the link to Rust? Well, OpenStar actually used Rust to create the optimise the design of the magnet to figure out how to keep components within the magnet functional at absolute zero  while also being a few centremetres away from plasma that's hotter than the sun.

To secure your spot, register for the conference now and add the "OpenStar Fusion Reactor Tour" to your booking!
